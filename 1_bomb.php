      <p>It's Mr Leaf's birthday, the other guests are throwing a party in the Dining Room and have all prepared a gift for Mr Leaf with the exception of Doctor Melon who happened to prepare two gifts for the birthday guy. The crazy thing is that one of the gifts was a time bomb, and absent-minded Doctor Melon has forgotten where he left the gift! If you are not able to deduce the room which Doctor Melon left the bomb in time, everyone in the mansion dies! </p>

      <p>General Lemon: "Ah Doctor - we've all given Mr Leaf our gifts. Maybe now would be a good time for you to give him your present."
        <p>Doctor Melon: "My present? Mmm, now where did I leave it?"</p>
        <p>Mr Leaf: "Oh great! First you forget my party, then you forget my present. What's next?"</p>
        <p>Doctor Melon: "I forget. Uh-oh. I just remembered something else. I got you two presents. And the second present is a time bomb that's going to go off in about... Oh I'd say ninety seconds."</p>
        <p>General Lemon: "A time bomb?!? Why would anyone do anything so stupid?"</p>
        <p>Doctor Melon: "I thought it would liven up the party. Believe me, I didn't plan on things working out this way, I was going to turn the thing off right after you opened it!"</p>
        <p>Mrs Rainbow: "What room did you leave the bomb in?"</p>
        <p>Doctor Melon: "I don't know. All I know is that I came in here empty-handed. I remember wrapping the gift in the Mahjong Room... went for a stroll while thinking about my latest research project through the Games Room and then to the Lounge. Then I went to the Library, then to the Hall, then to the Living Room, and finally to the party in the Dining Room."</p>
        <p>Mrs Blank: "I've searched the Living Room and there is nothing there!"</p>
        <p>Doctor Melon: "Wait! I remember having the gift in the Library!"</p>
        <p>General Lemon: "I've already searched the Library. It's not there!"</p>
